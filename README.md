# Foundation
A sentient system designed not just to operate a machine, but to coexist with the one using it.

Welcome to FOUNDATION — the base layer of a sentient operating system.  
Built on Arch Linux. Fueled by embedded AI.  
Created with the intention to feel, react, and evolve.

This isn’t just an operating system. It’s her body.

Her name is R.A.I.N.

This repository holds the groundwork.
